## 💼 What I've Built

### Software-Based 3D Graphics Engine
[View Project →](https://github.com/hyperactive-panda111/3d-software-renderer)

CPU-based graphics pipeline built from scratch without any graphics APIs.

- Achieved 30 FPS rendering of 10,000 vertices with 50% CPU performance improvement through backface culling, six-plane frustum clipping, and cache-optimized data layout
- Built OBJ model loader and perspective-correct texture mapping for realistic rendering
- Implemented complete rendering pipeline without external graphics APIs: transformations, clipping, rasterization, Z-buffering

### Workflow Automation Platform
[View Project →](https://github.com/hyperactive-panda111/workflow-automation)

End-to-end SaaS enabling users to orchestrate distributed background jobs and AI integrations through a visual workflow builder.

- Architected workflow orchestration engine with durable job execution using Inngest
- Built unified AI integration layer abstracting OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini APIs with rate-limit handling
- Implemented full SaaS infrastructure: auth, billing, error tracking, and type-safe API layer

### Chirp - Full-Stack Social Media Platform
[View Project →](https://github.com/hyperactive-panda111/chirp)

Modern social media application with real-time capabilities and infinite scrolling.

- Built full authentication system with Clerk and user profile management
- Implemented infinite-scrolling feed with React Query for optimized data fetching
- Integrated ImageKit for scalable image hosting and Prisma ORM with Neon PostgreSQL
- Designed responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and Socket.IO infrastructure for real-time features

## 📊 Impact Highlights

- Reduced PostgreSQL load by **70%** with debounce-based autosave optimization
- Improved CPU rendering performance by **50%** through algorithmic optimizations
- Built concurrency-safe Stripe webhook infrastructure for reliable billing
- Designed zero-downtime CI/CD pipelines on Vercel
